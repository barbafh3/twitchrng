# TwitchRNG

TwitchRNG emulates the fixed program rotation of TV channels using twitch streams.

## Current Features

* Streams rotate on a fixed timer playing one random stream of the Top 100.
* Possibility of stoping the rotation and keep watching the current stream.

## TODO:

* On top of randomizing the streams, have a list of future streams to work as a schedule.
* Channels based on games/tags. Aside from the Overall Top 100 channel, other options should exist for specific games or specific genres/activities.
* Create custom channels. Custom channels would be based on user defined tags/games.
